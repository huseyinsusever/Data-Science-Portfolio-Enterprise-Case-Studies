# Data-Science-Portfolio-Enterprise-Case-Studies
Welcome to my professional data science portfolio. This repository contains end-to-end analytics projects focusing on predictive modeling, business intelligence, and real-time data processing using industry-standard methodologies (IBM & SpaceX standards).

🚀 Project 1: SpaceX Launch Success Prediction
Goal: Determining the economic feasibility of rocket launches by predicting first-stage landing success.

Key Contributions:
Data Engineering: Automated data collection from the SpaceX REST API, handling complex nested JSON structures.

Modern Data Wrangling: Cleaned messy datasets and handled missing values using Pandas 3.0-ready fillna() methods.

Geospatial Analytics: Visualized launch site proximities to critical infrastructure using Folium interactive maps.

Machine Learning: Developed a classification pipeline (Logistic Regression, SVM) to predict landing outcomes with high accuracy.

📉 Project 2: IBM Telco Customer Churn Analytics
Goal: Identifying high-risk customers to reduce churn and maximize retention for a telecommunications provider.

Key Contributions:
Business Insights: Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to reveal that "Month-to-month" contracts are the primary drivers of customer loss.

Predictive Modeling: Built a Random Forest classifier achieving 79% accuracy in identifying potential churners.

Executive Dashboards: Created IBM-branded visualizations for "AI-Driven Business Drivers" to assist management in decision-making.

🛠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, Folium

Specialized Topics: Computer Vision (CNN for food classification), Deep Learning.
